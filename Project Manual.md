Project description + Visualizations for 1st Feedback meeting:

To fabricate the PCB; Cutting, drilling, placing graphics, etching, putting on a solder mask, and printing are all part of the process.
A PCB (Printed Circuit Board) consists of the following components.

PCB's may be designed as single-layer, double-layer or multi-layer. In this preject we will be dealing with double-layer design with the images in 2 dimension only.
Double layer PCB comes with 2 layers of conducting material on both sides of the board. Each side is also used for incorporating different electronic components on top of the board. 
Double layer PCB's are widely used in a variety of different electronic sectors where low costs are required.

In a single fabricated PCB, there can be quite a few types of defects. Out of the multitudes of defects, we will concern ourselves with the following 6 defects:

Figure 2 : (a) missing hole; (b) mouse bite; (c) open circuit; (d) short circuit; (e) spur; (f) spurious copper.

Before the components are attched onto the board, the routes/traces are etched. These etches complete the circuit according to the design. 
Most of the defects (mouse bite; open circuit; short circuit; spur; spurious copper) occur at this stage but can only be detected once the PCB is manufactured and ready for component soldering.
